For this project, I developed a Weather App using Python, leveraging PyQt5 for the graphical user interface (GUI) and integrating data from the OpenWeather API for real-time 
weather information.



Key Features:

• Real-Time Weather Data: The app fetches up-to-date weather information based on the user’s location or input city. It displays current conditions such as temperature, 
weather description, and an icon representing the weather.

• User-Friendly Interface: The app features an intuitive and responsive interface created with PyQt5, where users can easily input a city name and retrieve relevant weather data.

• API Integration: I utilized the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data. This integration allows the app to pull current weather details based on the city entered by the user.

• Dynamic Updates: The app retrieves live weather data each time a user enters a new city, ensuring the information is always current.



Tools and Technologies:

• Python: Used as the primary programming language to handle the logic of the app and communicate with the OpenWeather API.

• PyQt5: Used for designing and developing the graphical user interface (GUI) of the application, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.

• OpenWeather API: The data source for the weather information, providing real-time weather data such as temperature, conditions, wind speed, and more.

• JSON: Utilized to parse and handle the data retrieved from the API, ensuring it is displayed in a user-friendly format.



Functionality:



The application prompts the user to input a city name and then makes an API request to fetch weather data. The app processes the response and updates the GUI with the current temperature, weather condition, humidity, and a weather icon. The data is dynamically updated when the user enters a new city name.



This weather app showcases my ability to work with APIs, Python, and GUI design using PyQt5, along with my skills in integrating external data into user-friendly applications. It demonstrates proficiency in handling real-time data, API integration, and creating a smooth, interactive user interface.
